        <h1>Projects</h1>

        <p>
          In my personal projects, I code in Ruby on Rails.<br>
          In 2012, I was a <a href="http://railsgirls.com">Rails Girls</a> coach at two events,
          in <a href="http://railsgirls.com/zagreb">Zagreb</a>, and <a href="http://railsgirls.com/ljubljana">Ljubljana</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://github.com/ivana" rel="me">My open-source code</a> is hosted on GitHub.
          Some of my <i>pets</i> are listed below.
        </p>

        <article>
          <h2><a href="http://smokefreebars.herokuapp.com/">Smoke-free bars in Zagreb</a></h2>
          <p>
            A list and map of bars and caf√©s in Zagreb where smoking is not allowed.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used Foursquare API, Google Maps API, Rails 3.2, CoffeeScript, jQuery, and MongoDB with Mongoid.

          <h2><a href="http://movi.im/">movi.im</a></h2>
          <p>
            Keep track of movies you watch, as well as ones you want to watch, and ones your friends watch.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is a Rails app that <a href="http://twitter.com/mislav">@mislav</a> and I created, and it's still a work in progress.
            If you're crazy about movies, you should definitely <a href="http://movi.im/">try it out</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Find out more about the <a href="http://movi.im/about">technologies we used</a>.<br>
            Can you beat the number of the <a href="http://movi.im/ivana" rel="me">movies I've watched</a>?

        <article>
          <h2><a href="http://todaslistas.heroku.com/">Todas Listas</a></h2>
          <p>
            My <a href="http://todaslistas.heroku.com/">to-do list app</a>. (Everybody has one.)
          </p>
          <p>
            What's different with this one? It's simple, you get to see all your todos at once, grouped in post-it-lookalike lists. And it looks great on your mobile device.
            <a href="http://todaslistas.heroku.com/">Give it a try!</a>
          </p>
